Comments:

There was a fair bit of issues and/or inconsistencies in the course material for this one.

1. Node version required to work with sequilize-typescript is depricated.

An explaination of the issue i faced was outlined by another person here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66836644/unable-to-connect-to-aws-rds-using-sequelize-orm

In the course project, I used node 12 to be consistent with the version required for the course excersizes.

2. Jimp has some issues with the test case outlined in the rubric.  There are several fourm msgs regarding this issue, all of which state to ignore the test cases that fail. Which is a little unnerving because I litterally have to click a checkbox saying my code passes the test cases in order to submit the assignment.

Here is a couple references to the issues:
